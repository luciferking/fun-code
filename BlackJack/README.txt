Some findings - 
I never have gambled yet in my life :) but I went through BlackJack youtube videos and wrote the BlackJack here. Since I found different definitions for wining - I count wining the table as 1 win from 1 game. I interpreted shuffling of deck on every 6 rounds as shuffle and use the cards from older hands.
